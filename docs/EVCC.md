# üöó EVCC Custom Charger and a Smappee EV Wallbox

Welcome! üéâ This page helps you integrate your **Smappee Wallbox** into [EVCC](https://evcc.io) using data from **Home Assistant**. It's still a work in progress, and I welcome **all suggestions and feedback**!

Thanks to [@marq24](https://github.com/marq24) for the pioneering guide on this topic:  


## üöÄ Step-by-Step Setup
All details can be found in following link: üîó [Home Assistant as EVCC Source](https://github.com/marq24/ha-evcc/blob/main/HA_AS_EVCC_SOURCE.md)

### ‚úÖ Step 1: Make Home Assistant Data Accessible
- Create a **long-lived access token** in Home Assistant.
- Make sure Home Assistant is reachable over your LAN (e.g. `http://192.168.x.x:8123`).

### ‚úÖ Step 2: Collect Sensor Names
- Identify all relevant `sensor.*`, `switch.*` and `number.*` entities created by your Smappee integration.

### ‚úÖ Step 3: Define Your Charger in `evcc.yaml`

Below, you can find a full example for a Smappee EV Wallbox. The configuration was recently set up and is currently undergoing testing. The main idea is following:

We do not use the smart functions of the Smappee app, in contrary, we use it in Standard mode, with specific current targets.

üîå Key Item: Charging Enable Control

Below is the full yaml for the charger.

```yaml

## üîå YAML Example: circuits configuration for peak shaving / load balancing ??

```yaml
circuits:
- name: main
  title: main circuit
  maxCurrent: 75 # on my home circuit breaker3 x 25A 
  maxPower: 4500 # max power I like to allow - I have it configured in Smappee as 5kW
  meter: Grid_smappee
```

You still have to include a loadpoint:
```yaml
loadpoints:
    - title: Carport # display name for UI
      charger: smappee # charger
      vehicle: Ford_explorer # default vehicle
      circuit: main
      phases: 0  ## to allow for 1 and 3 phases - to be evaluated
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è EVCC requires high update rates for sensors

The original Smappee integration (with Smappee Infinity/Connect) does not provide sufficiently fast updates.

Therefore, I integrated this via Modbus.

The Smappee Infinity/Genius also supports MQTT, which is nicely explained by Smappee.

üëâ Please see the new [document](./Smappee_modbus.md) for details on using Modbus sensors in Home Assistant with Smappee Connect.

Other options to consider as input for EVCC include:
- Your P1 meter
- Direct sensor data from your PV system
All those integrations are nicely explained on the EVCC website documentation.
