### ‚ÑπÔ∏è Smappee EV usage and Entity Overview in Home Assistant

This integration exposes a variety of entities, buttons, and services that allow you to control and monitor your **Smappee EV Wallbox** via Home Assistant, or to be used in other third party EMS systems, such as [EVCC](https://github.com/myny-git/smappee_ev/blob/main/docs/EVCC.md), [emhass](https://github.com/myny-git/smappee_ev/blob/main/docs/emhass.md), and [openEMS](https://github.com/myny-git/smappee_ev/blob/main/docs/openEMS.md). Below you'll find a detailed explanation of each component and how to use them effectively in your automations, scripts, or dashboards.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The Smappee APP is not so responsive. Better to use the online Smappee Dashboard to evaluate functionality. 

These entities are based on the API-call [Smappee API](https://smappee.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/DEVAPI/overview). 

### üõ†Ô∏è Services

This integration firstly creates several services, which can be called directly in automations, scripts, or the Developer Tools ‚Üí Actions (UI) in Home Assistant.

- **`smappee_ev.set_charging_mode`**  
Sets the desired charging mode. You must provide a `mode` parameter with one of the following values: `SMART`, `SOLAR` or `NORMAL`.
At first, there are in fact only 3 modes in your app or on the dashboard: standard (link to NORMAL), smart, solar. The standard mode does not have smart features, you can only set the charging speed or current. In this mode, you can set the current limit (in A) in integer values. Take care, this is NOT the max current at your connector, as that's a fixed setting, depending on your setup. The programmed current is the max current you allow in THIS mode.

- **`smappee_ev.start_charging`**  
Starts a charging session using a **current limit** parameter.  Requesting this multiple times with different percentage levels has an impact, but you need to refresh your screen, or switch to another tab (like Smart) and return.

- **`smappee_ev.pause_charging`**  
Pauses the currently active charging session.

- **`smappee_ev.stop_charging`**  
Stops the charging session. 

- **`smappee_ev.set_min_surpluspct`**  
Sets the min surplus percentage before enabling the connector in SOLAR mode. Take care, the dashboard doesn't reflect immediately the changed number. If you go to another screen, and return, then it is modified.

### üîò Buttons and numbers
This integration also created a few buttons and number entities, which make use of aforementioned services. You can use them in your Home Assistant dashboards. Some entities will be created per connector number. 

- **`select.smappee_ev_charging_mode_1`**  
Allows you to choose between the following charging modes per connector (1 or 2):
  - `SMART`: Balances grid and solar energy
  - `SOLAR`: Charges using solar power only
  - `NORMAL`: Charges at a fixed current limit (with the `max_charging_speed` entity)

- **`number.smappee_ev_max_charging_speed_1`**  
Defines the current (in Amps) to be used when operating in `NORMAL` mode (aka Standard). Adjust this to match your desired charging speed. This number will be available per connector (1 or 2). Some examples:
#### üöó Charging Power Table

| Current (A) | Power (1 phase, kW) | Power (3 phases, kW) |
|-------------|----------------------|------------------------|
| 6 A         | 1.38 kW              | 4.15 kW                |
| 8 A         | 1.84 kW              | 5.54 kW                |
| 10 A        | 2.30 kW              | 6.92 kW                |
| 16 A        | 3.68 kW              | 11.07 kW               |
| 24 A        | 5.52 kW              | 16.61 kW               |
| 32 A        | 7.36 kW              | 22.14 kW               |

- **`number.smappee_ev_min_surplus_percentage_1`**  
[Explanation from the website of Smappee]

This slider sets **how much of the minimum required current (6A or 3x6A)** must be covered by surplus solar production before charging starts. You can thus reduce the percentage of surplus needed to begin charging.

| Slider Value [%] | Charging of your EV |
|------------------|--------------------|
| 0   | The charger always charges at minimum speed (Single phase: 1.4‚ÄØkW, Three phase: 4.2‚ÄØkW) and increases speed when more surplus solar is available. |
| 25  | 25% must come from the solar panels, 75% from the grid (Single phase: 0.35‚ÄØkW export, Three phase: 1.05‚ÄØkW export). |
| 50  | 50% must come from the solar panels, 50% from the grid (Single phase: 0.7‚ÄØkW export, Three phase: 2.1‚ÄØkW export). |
| 100 | 100% must come from the solar panels (Single phase: 1.4‚ÄØkW export, Three phase: 4.2‚ÄØkW export). |

> **Note:**  
> There is a known issue in the Smappee app:  
> While the minimum surplus percentage works and updates correctly in the online dashboard, you may need to swap modes and return to see the change reflected on the dashboard‚Äîit does not update live. Somehow, the app never gets updated!

- **`number.smappee_ev_led_brightness`**  
Sets the desired brightness level for the Wallbox LEDs, from 0 to 100%.
   
- **`button.smappee_ev_set_charging_mode_1`**  
Applies the currently selected `charging mode` from the select entity, and in case of NORMAL, it uses the current limit of the corresponding charging speed entity. Use this after changing the mode to activate it on the Wallbox. It is connector-specific.

- **`button.smappee_ev_start_charging_1`**  
Starts a charging session using the value set in `number.smappee_ev_wallbox_max_charging_speed`. Pressing multiple times with different current levels has an impact, but you need to refresh your screen! Also connector-specific.

- **`button.smappee_ev_pause_charging_1`**  
Pauses the ongoing charging session. Charging can later be resumed.

- **`button.smappee_ev_stop_charging_1`**  
Stops the current charging session entirely. Useful for ending sessions manually or through automations. Also connector-specific.

### üìà Sensor Entities

**`sensor.charging_state_1`**  
Reports the current session state per connector ID. Possible values include:
- `CHARGING`: An active charging session is ongoing.
- `SUSPENDED`: Charging is suspended, e.g., due to insufficient solar power or limits, or when you PAUSED the charging.

**`sensor.evcc_state_1`**  
Displays the EVCC (Electric Vehicle Communication Controller) state of the Wallbox, per connector ID, following IEC 61851:
- `A`: No vehicle connected
- `B`: Vehicle connected but not ready
- `C`: Vehicle connected and ready for charging
- `E`: Error state

**`sensor.evcc_state-us_1`**  
Displays the state of the Wallbox, per connector ID, similar as on the dashboard

### EVCC specific entity

**`switch.smappee_ev_evcc_charging_control_1`**  
The integration of EVCC requires a switch (per connector ID), which:
- `turn_on`: call internally the service start_charging (NORMAL) with current limit 6A.
- `turn_off`: call internally the service pause_charging.
Please see the [EVCC](https://github.com/myny-git/smappee_ev/blob/main/docs/EVCC.md) documentation for the usage.
