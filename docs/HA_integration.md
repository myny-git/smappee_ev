### ‚ÑπÔ∏è Smappee EV usage and Entity Overview in Home Assistant

This integration exposes a variety of entities, buttons, and services that allow you to control and monitor your **Smappee EV Wallbox** via Home Assistant, or to be used in other third party EMS systems, such as [EVCC](https://github.com/myny-git/smappee_ev/blob/main/docs/EVCC.md), [emhass](https://github.com/myny-git/smappee_ev/blob/main/docs/emhass.md), and [openEMS](https://github.com/myny-git/smappee_ev/blob/main/docs/openEMS.md). Below you'll find a detailed explanation of each component and how to use them effectively in your automations, scripts, or dashboards.

These entities are based on the [Smappee API](https://smappee.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/DEVAPI/overview). 

### üõ†Ô∏è Services

This integration firstly creates several services, which can be called directly in automations, scripts, or the Developer Tools ‚Üí Actions (UI) in Home Assistant.

- **`smappee_ev.set_charging_mode`**  
Sets the desired charging mode. You must provide a `mode` parameter with one of the following values: `SMART`, `SOLAR`, `NORMAL`, or `NORMAL_PERCENTAGE`.
At first, there are in fact only 3 modes in your app or on the dashboard: standard, smart, solar. Smart and Solar represent the first two modes. NORMAL and NORMAL_PERCENTAGE represent the Standard mode, without smart features. In this mode, you can set the current limit (in A) or the percentage limit (in %), both in integer values. Take care, this is NOT the max current at your connector, as that's a fixed setting, depending on your setup. The programmed current is the max current you allow in THIS mode.

- **`smappee_ev.start_charging`**  
Starts a charging session using the configured **percentage limit** from the `number.smappee_ev_wallbox_percentage_limit` entity. Nothing will happen to the current limit value in your integration. Requesting this multiple times with different percentage levels has an impact, but you need to refresh your screen, or switch to another tab (like Smart) and return.

- **`smappee_ev.pause_charging`**  
Pauses the currently active charging session and returns to the basic standard screen. Your currents/percentage limit are unaltered, however they may NOT be in sync with your home assistant integration.
Like in the Smappee app, pressing Pause Charging changes the mode to NORMAL.
To resume smart charging, manually set the mode again (e.g., SMART) and press Set Charging Mode.

- **`smappee_ev.stop_charging`**  
Stops the charging session entirely. It will also update the max charging speed to 32A (or your max) or 100%. 

- **`smappee_ev.set_available`**  
Makes the Wallbox available for charging again (if it was marked unavailable).

- **`smappee_ev.set_unavailable`**  
Makes the Wallbox unavailable (e.g., for manual control or maintenance purposes or perhaps holiday mode).

- **`smappee_ev.set_brightness`**  
Sets the LED brightness on the Wallbox. Requires a `brightness` parameter (0‚Äì100) in percentage. Take care, you don't see an immediate update in your app, you have to exit this screen (e.g. by going to the home page) and return, or refresh the screen. Afterwards, your programmed LED brightness value will appear.

- **`smappee_ev.reload`**  
Reloads all Smappee EV Wallbox entries without requiring a restart of Home Assistant. Useful when reloading config or fixing communication.

### üîò Buttons and numbers
This integration also created a few buttons and number entities, which make use of aforementioned services. You can use them in your Home Assistant dashboards.

- **`select.smappee_ev_wallbox_charging_mode`**  
Allows you to choose between the following charging modes:
  - `SMART`: Balances grid and solar energy
  - `SOLAR`: Charges using solar power only
  - `NORMAL`: Charges at a fixed current limit (with the `current_limit` entity)
  - `NORMAL_PERCENTAGE`: Charges up to a defined percentage (with the `percentage_limit` entity)

- **`number.smappee_ev_wallbox_current_limit`**  
Defines the current (in Amps) to be used when operating in `NORMAL` mode (aka Standard). Adjust this to match your desired charging speed. When you change the current limit entity, the percentage limit will remain unaltered. Some examples:
#### üöó Charging Power Table

| Current (A) | Power (1 phase, kW) | Power (3 phases, kW) |
|-------------|----------------------|------------------------|
| 6 A         | 1.38 kW              | 4.15 kW                |
| 8 A         | 1.84 kW              | 5.54 kW                |
| 10 A        | 2.30 kW              | 6.92 kW                |
| 16 A        | 3.68 kW              | 11.07 kW               |
| 24 A        | 5.52 kW              | 16.61 kW               |
| 32 A        | 7.36 kW              | 22.14 kW               |


- **`number.smappee_ev_wallbox_percentage_limit`**  
Sets the maximum percentage of charging when using `NORMAL_PERCENTAGE` mode (aka Standard), or when starting a session via `start_charging`. When you change the percentage limit entity, the current limit will remain unaltered. The table below shows the corresponding currents for a min current of 6A and a max allowed current of 32A.

#### üîå Charging Current by Percentage

| Percentage (%) | Current (A) |
|----------------|-------------|
| 0              | 6.0         |
| 5              | 7.3         |
| 10             | 8.6         |
| 25             | 12.5        |
| 50             | 19.0        |
| 100            | 32.0        |

- **`number.smappee_ev_wallbox_led_brightness`**  
Sets the desired brightness level for the Wallbox LEDs, from 0 to 100%.
   
- **`button.smappee_ev_wallbox_set_charging_mode`**  
Applies the currently selected `charging mode` from the select entity, and in case of NORMAL or NORMAL_PERCENTAGE, uses the current limit or percentage limit of the corresponding number entity. Use this after changing the mode and current to activate it on the Wallbox.

- **`button.smappee_ev_wallbox_start_charging`**  
Starts a charging session using the value set in `number.smappee_ev_wallbox_percentage_limit`. Pressing multiple times with different percentage levels has an impact, but you need to refresh your screen!

- **`button.smappee_ev_wallbox_pause_charging`**  
Pauses the ongoing charging session. Charging can later be resumed.
Like in the Smappee app, pressing Pause Charging changes the mode to NORMAL.
To resume smart charging, manually set the mode again (e.g., SMART) and press Set Charging Mode.

- **`button.smappee_ev_wallbox_stop_charging`**  
Stops the current charging session entirely. Useful for ending sessions manually or through automations. It will also update the max charging speed to 32A (or your max) or 100%, but not in your Home Assistant. 

- **`button.smappee_ev_wallbox_set_led_brightness`**  
Applies the brightness level set in `number.smappee_ev_wallbox_led_brightness` to the Wallbox LEDs.

- **`button.smappee_ev_wallbox_set_available`**  
Marks the Wallbox as available for use. Required before charging can start if the Wallbox was previously marked as unavailable.

- **`button.smappee_ev_wallbox_set_unavailable`**  
Marks the Wallbox as unavailable. This can be used to disable charging when not in use or during maintenance.

### üìà Sensor Entities

**`sensor.session_state`**  
Reports the current session state. Possible values include:
- `CHARGING`: An active charging session is ongoing.
- `SUSPENDED`: Charging is suspended, e.g., due to insufficient solar power or limits, or when you PAUSED the charging.

**`sensor.evcc_state`**  
Displays the EVCC (Electric Vehicle Communication Controller) state of the Wallbox, following IEC 61851:
- `A`: No vehicle connected
- `B`: Vehicle connected but not ready
- `C`: Vehicle connected and ready for charging
- `E`: Error state
