## ⚠️ Check for the Latest Version in HACS

HACS does not always notify you of updates automatically. Please:

1. Go to `HACS` > Integrations in Home Assistant  
2. Search for `smappee`  
3. Click the 3-dot menu next to the integration  
4. Choose `Update Information`  
5. If an update is available, install it **before reporting this issue**

## ✅ Pre-Check Checklist

Please confirm **all** of the following before submitting:

- [ ] I confirm that no other conflicting Smappee EV integrations are installed or configured (including deactivated ones — the official Smappee integration does not count).
- [ ] My Home Assistant version is up to date.
- [ ] I am using the **latest version** of this integration (verified via HACS).
- [ ] I have reviewed [open and closed issues](https://github.com/myny-git/smappee_ev/issues?q=is%3Aissue) to avoid duplicates.
- [ ] I have enabled and prepared DEBUG log output (for bug reports).
- [ ] This is a bug report — not a general usage question.
