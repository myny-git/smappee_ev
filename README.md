> [!NOTE]
As the original Home Assistant integration of Smappee does not allow to control the EV charger, I updated the fork to include following charging modes to home assistant:
> **SOLAR / SMART and STANDARD**
>  
>  PS: I own an EV Wall Home, with 1 cable. This is what I used for testing.
>

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This is a HACS custom integration. Don't try to add this repository as an add-on in Home Assistant.

## Installation Instructions (3 Steps)
### Step 1. HACS add the Integration

[![Open your Home Assistant instance and adding repository to HACS.](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/hacs_repository.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/hacs_repository/?owner=myny-git&repository=smappee_ev&category=integration)

1. In HA HACS, you need to add a new custom repository (via the 'three dots' menu in the top right corner).
2. Enter https://github.com/marq24/ha-fordpass as the repository URL (and select  the type `Integration`).
3. After adding the new repository, you can search for `fordpass` in the search bar.
4. Important there is already a default HACS fordpass integration â€” Please make sure to select the 'correct' one with the description: _FordPass integration for Home Assistant [fork optimized for EV's & EVCC]_.
5. Install the 'correct' (aka 'this') fordpass integration (v2025.5.0 or higher).
6. Restart HA.
