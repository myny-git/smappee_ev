# Smappee_EV
Smappee EV Home Assistant HACS

This is a fork of gvnuland / smappee_ev, so all credits for the initial version to @gvnuland.

The main idea is to include **SOLAR / SMART and STANDARD** charging in home assistant.

Please feel free to use this repo in home assistant - as long as Smappee did not include their improvements.

The repo is based on API calls from [smappee atlassian.net](https://smappee.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/DEVAPI/overview?homepageId=9306173)
